# Features-extraction-from-the-EEG-signal-in-the-study-of-ASMR
Purpose of this project is comparing StrongASMR responders with PreRelaxed state by extracting topological features from EEG signals, to see how ASMR affects on topological features . Our goal is to create persistent diagram for both cases and using Wasserstein distance understand the difference between them.
